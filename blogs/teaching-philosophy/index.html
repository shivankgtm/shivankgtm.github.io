            Defining outcomes helps us bring everyone on the same page. We have already defined what participants should expect when they complete the cohort.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4 ml-12 text-lg leading-8 font-mono">
            ‚û§ Participants can think towards the right approach for the solution <br>
            ‚û§ Asking Right Questions</strong> <br>
            ‚û§ Participants understand the code flow and design principles of Python, Django, and Rest framework <br>
            ‚û§ Able to use Git and Github for version control <br>
            ‚û§ Able to convert the solution into code using Python üêç <br>

        [ IMPORTANT ]: If your aim is outside of the mentioned outcomes, this cohort is probably not for you.
        For example, if you're thinking any of the following, this cohort is not for you:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 ml-12 text-lg leading-8 font-mono">
        ‚û§ I'll get to learn some frontend : NO WE WILL NOT BE TEACHING FRONTEND(except one guest lecture), THIS COHORT IS PURE BACKEND<br>
        ‚û§ I'll get a certificate : NO WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN PROVIDING CERTIFICATES, though you can expect your <strong>Github</strong> profile to be better.<br>
        ‚û§ I'll just come to class and not do any homework : NO, YOU WILL HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK<br>

            The reason to limit the cohort strength to 15 is to ensure that everyone gets the attention they need.
            Last year we had 22 students and most of them provided great feedback but we believe we would be able to
            get better Placed to Student ratio if we'll have a smaller cohort.<br> <br>

            For our teaching pattern, we follow the Kota Pattern.<br><br>
            So, what's the deal with the Kota Model, you ask? Well, buckle up, because it's about to blow your mind. Picture this: for a solid 2-3 hours every day, we dive headfirst into pure technical goodness. We're talking about hardcore discussions, deep dives into the nitty-gritty of coding ‚Äì the kind of stuff that <strong>separates the amateurs from the pros.</strong> üíªüí°
            <br><br>
            But wait, there's more. Once the classroom session wraps up, it's not time to kick back and relax. Oh no, that's when the real fun begins. We're talking about homework, but not your run-of-the-mill assignments. We're talking about <strong>Daily Practice Problems</strong> ‚Äì the secret sauce that turns knowledge into mastery üìö‚ú®.
