            Defining outcomes helps us bring everyone on the same page. We have already defined what participants should expect when they complete the cohort.

        <p class="mt-4 ml-12 text-lg leading-8 font-mono">
            ‚û§ Participants can think towards the right approach for the solution <br>
            ‚û§ Asking Right Questions</strong> <br>
            ‚û§ Participants understand the code flow and design principles of Python, Django, and Rest framework <br>
            ‚û§ Able to use Git and Github for version control <br>
            ‚û§ Able to convert the solution into code using Python üêç <br>

        [ IMPORTANT ]: If your aim is outside of the mentioned outcomes, this cohort is probably not for you.
        For example, if you're thinking any of the following, this cohort is not for you:
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 ml-12 text-lg leading-8 font-mono">
        ‚û§ I'll get to learn some frontend : NO WE WILL NOT BE TEACHING FRONTEND(except one guest lecture), THIS COHORT IS PURE BACKEND<br>
        ‚û§ I'll get a certificate : NO WE DO NOT PROVIDE CERTIFICATES, WE PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE<br>
        ‚û§ I'll just come to class and not do any homework : NO, YOU WILL HAVE TO DO HOMEWORK<br>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">Teaching <span class="text-pink-900">Pattern</span></h3>
        <p class="mt-4 ml-6 text-lg leading-8">
            The reason to limit the cohort strength to 15 is to ensure that everyone gets the attention they need.
            Last year we had 22 students and most of them provided great feedback but we believe we would be able to
            get better Placed to Student ratio if we'll have a smaller cohort.<br> <br>

            For our teaching pattern, we follow the Kota Pattern. We require the participants to dedicate at least
            6 hours a day for the cohort, which includes 2-3 hours in classroom and 3-4 hours of self-study. For self-study,
            we provide sheets and DPP (Daily Practice Problems) which are to be solved by the participants.
